    "I am a fullstack web developer and a Computer Science student at the University of Ibadan. I have been fascinated by computers since I was 10, but I never really got to know what is possible with them until later. Now, I know, and want to do wonders with them.",
    "I am looking for a junior role where I can join others to do wonders while learning from senior developers what works best in what situation.",
    "I am also interested in cloud technologies and machine learning and I love music, reading and travelling."
